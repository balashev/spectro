Absorption line analysis:

1. Load spectrum or list of spectra
   a. Load the 
   b. Set the resolution of the spectrum (in the last column), by pressing <F3> or menu View/Exposures
    
2. Construct continuum:
   a. B-splain:
       to add points for B-splain: 
          - mouse right click while <b> key is hold.  
          - short press <b> key while fixed mouse
       to remove points for B-splain:
          - hold <b> key. Choose to region using Left button of mouse
          - hold <b> key. Press Right Button of Mouse. The closer to cursor position splain point will be removed.
2'. Normalize the spectrum (unnecessary, but reasonable):
   a. Pressing <n> button or Normalize button in the bottom panel - will switch between Normalize and Nonnormalized view
             
3. Construct fit model.
   a. Press Ctrl+f.
   b. Choose parameters in opened window
   c. Add absorption system by pressing Add System
   d. Add species to system by typing species name (like OI, H2j0, e.t.c.) or select in <add species> window. 
   e. Select appropriate intervals of min, max for the fitting parameters, e.g. z, b, N, e.t.c
    
4. Fit:
   press Fit button at the bottom panel, or in the Fit Menu.

5. Made figures:
   a. Press Ctrl + L or Main Menu / View / Plot lines
   b. Choose lines or regions:
      line can be seleted by
         - double click on line indicator
         - writing in the window at right-hand side in Plot lines window
         - choosing from the list at the bottom of right-hand side
      selected lines will be highlighted by red color
      you can specify yaxis scale for specific line just adding it to the line, like "FeI2434 0.5 1.2"  
      
   c. Set parameters of Matplotlib figures

Working with Doublets:
To add Doublet use <u> key and left mouse click: 
    1. Press <u> key and hold it during the following actions.
    2. Set the position of the first line in doublet by <Left mouse Click>. It will be shown by green vertical line.
    3. The possible positions of the second lines in doublet will be highlighted by red lines.
    4. Select second line in doublet <Left mouse Click>. 
    5. If the second and first clicked satisfy some tollerance ratio, than double will be formed.

To shift doublet position: Hold <Shift> and drag doublet by its label.
To delete doublet: Hold <Ctrl> and click on the doublet label.
To set redshift value for other indicators: <Double Left Mouse Click> on the doublet label.

Working with regions:  
- to construct         :         hold <r> Key and select region by left mouse button
- to adjust boundaries :         hold SHIFT and move boundaries by mouse
- to drag              :         hold SHIFT and move by mouse
- to remove            :         hold CTRL and click on the region
- to collapse/expand   :         left mouse button double click on the region
