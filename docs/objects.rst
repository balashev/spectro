Objects in GUI
==============

The keyboard provide the easy access to the GUI instruments. Most of the useful commands can be assessed form the keyboard.

Line labels
-----------

Line labels is a basic interactive graphical objects, which indicate a possible positions of the absorption/emission lines corresponding to atomic/molacular transitions. The vertical position of the line label is tight to the spectrum and the horizontal position can be changed either by moving line labels (using mouse and keyboard) or by setting appropriate redshift in the redshift field in the :ref:`controlpanel`. There are useful interaction actions with line labels that ease the exploration of the spectrum

* **SHIFT + DRAG**: move the line label by changing its redshift 

* **SHIFT + LEFT CLICK**: set line label as a reference line, the the top axis will be scaled with velocity offset from this line.

* **CRTL + LEFT CLICK**: delete line label.

* **ALT + LEFT CLICK**: show extended information about this line.

* **h + LEFT CLICK**: highlight all line labels of the species (including level) that correspond to this line, similar to writing in the :ref:`console`: ``high <species>``.

* **h + LEFT CLICK**:
